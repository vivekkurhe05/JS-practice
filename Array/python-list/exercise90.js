/**
 * Write a Python program to count the number of lists in a given list of lists.
Original list:
[[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]
Number of lists in said list of lists:
4
Original list:
[[2, 4], [[6, 8], [4, 5, 8]], [10, 12, 14]]
Number of lists in said list of lists:
3

// my solution
let list1 = [[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]
console.log(list1.length)

let list2 = [[2, 4], [[6, 8], [4, 5, 8]], [10, 12, 14]]
console.log(list2.length)
