/**
 * Write a Python program to create a Caesar encryption.

Note : In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher,
Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter
some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3,
D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar,
who used it in his private correspondence.
